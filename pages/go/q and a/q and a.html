	<li>
	<h1 class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style11">Q: Does Go have a 
	runtime? </span><span class="auto-style12"><br class="auto-style3"></span>
	<span class="auto-style11">A: Yes, but Go's runtime is analogous to libc in 
	C, not a virtual machine in Java</span></h1>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h1 class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style11">Q: Why does Go not have 
	generic types?</span><span class="auto-style12"><br class="auto-style3">
	</span><span class="auto-style11">A: They are convenient but they come at a 
	cost in complexity</span></h1>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h1 class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style11">Q: Why does Go not have 
	exceptions?</span><span class="auto-style12"><br class="auto-style3"></span>
	<span class="auto-style11">A: We believe that coupling exceptions to a 
	control structure, as in the try-catch-finally idiom, results in convoluted 
	code</span></h1>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h1 class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style11">Q: Why does Go not 
	support overloading of methods and operators? </span>
	<span class="auto-style12"><br class="auto-style3"></span>
	<span class="auto-style11">A: It was occasionally useful but that it could 
	also be confusing and fragile in practice</span></h1>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h1 class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style11">Q: Why does Go not 
	provide implicit numeric conversions? </span><span class="auto-style12">
	<br class="auto-style3"></span><span class="auto-style11">A: It complicates 
	the compiler and result is not portable</span></h1>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h1 class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style11">Q: Why is my trivial 
	program such a large binary?</span><span class="auto-style12"><br class="auto-style3"></span>
	<span class="auto-style11">A: All Go binaries include the Go runtime, along 
	with the run-time type information necessary to support dynamic type checks, 
	reflection, and even panic-time stack traces</span></h1>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h1 class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style11">Q: Why is there no 
	pointer arithmetic?</span><span class="auto-style12"><br class="auto-style3"></span>
	<span class="auto-style11">A: Safety</span></h1>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h1 class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style11">Q: Can I stop these 
	complaints about my unused variable/import?</span><span class="auto-style12"><br class="auto-style3"></span><span class="auto-style11">
	A: The presence of an unused variable may indicate a bug and Go compiler did 
	not support warning</span></h1>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h1 class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style11">Q: Why Go compiler does 
	not report warnings, only errors?</span><span class="auto-style12"><br class="auto-style3"></span>
	<span class="auto-style11">A:&nbsp; First, it's worth complaining about.&nbsp; 
	Second, warning about weak case can be a noise that masking real errors that 
	should be fixed</span></h1>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h1 class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style11">Q: Why do garbage 
	collection? Won't it be too expensive?</span><span class="auto-style12"><br class="auto-style3"></span><span class="auto-style11">
	A: Managing the lifetimes of allocated objects is one of the biggest 
	bookkeeping and is often the cause of bugs.&nbsp; Even in languages like C++ 
	or Rust that provide mechanisms to assist, it often adding programming 
	overhead of its own. Advances in garbage collection technology gave us 
	confidence that it could be implemented cheaply enough</span></h1>
